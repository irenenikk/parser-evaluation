Comments:
Berkeley recognises correctly that "more" is modifying "unique", but does not recognise the type of dependency.
Stanford thinks "more" is modifying "function" (classified as amod). However, "less" is considered to modify unique. This means that the coordination of "or" has not been resolved correctly: "more" and "unique" are considered to be on the same level.

Neither parser can capture the appos of the example parentheticals: both tag the contents as discourse. However, they are mentioned, not used, which is why they should be tagged as appos to the preceeding head. In this example, punctuation acts as a coordinator, as it could be replaced with "and" or "or". 

Stanford uses appos to attach the contents of a list, which is incorrect as lists should be treated as coordinations. Stanford finds that the correct elements in the list  and its parentheticals have a dependency, but doesn't define the type of it. It misclassifies the relationship of "and" to "interjections" as "prep", instead of a coordination. It also correctly associates the head of the last parenthetical to the head it's an example of, but doesn't define the type of dependency. The Stanford parser also attaches the head of the last parenthetical to what it considers as the head of the construction, although it is an appos to "there". The Stanford parser correctly finds that "among" is attached to "interjections", but probably not for the right reasons. The Berkeley parser attaches it to the last element of the list, which a debatable solution. A viable option would have been to attach "among" to the head of the phrase, which is "has".

The Stanford parser also gets confused by "the existential there", which it classifies bizarrely. It considers "and" a preposition, and existential the prepositional object. It considers "there" to modify existential. The Berkeley parser can correctly identify "existential" as a modifier for "there".

Berkeley coordinates the list correctly, and also finds the correct dependent pairs in the parentheticals, but doesn't define a relationship type for them. It can even find that "are" is attached to "there" in the last parenthetical.

Stanford incorrectly classified "politeness" as an amod, meaning that it is an adjective, which is not the case.

Stanford ignores parentheses completely, whereas Berkeley tags them as punctuation.
