Comments:
Stanford has "which" as the object of "bad", although it cannot be interpreted as a verb, which Stanford does.
Stanford seems to interpret "rides" as the plural of a noun.
These two incorrect assumptions are present in all of the 5 best parses of the parser.

Berkeley doesn't recognise the relation between "bad" and "tempered".
Otherwise the Berkeley result is equal to the gold standard.
